An demonstration of AndroidMapRoute

I was looking for a way to get the route between 2 points and displayed in the Google Map using Google Maps API v2. After around many sites to get actual idea for how to implement the Map Route in Android using Google Map API v2.

First I will give you small & simple description about Map and Route.
-	Route is just Poly-lines which is connected with each other.
-	Google API gives route between two location.
-	Also give Distance, Total Duration, etc.
-	Just we want to give two coordinates between two location(cities, state, etc.)
